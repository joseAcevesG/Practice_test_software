## Commit Guidelines

### Conventional Commits

To maintain the quality and readability of our commit history, this repository enforces the use of the Conventional Commits specification for all commits. Conventional Commits provide a set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, making it easier to track changes and manage versioning.

#### Key Points:
- Commit messages must be structured as follows: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
- Common types include `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, and `chore`.
- Descriptions should be concise and descriptive of the changes made.
- Optionally, a longer commit body and a footer can be included for detailed explanations.
